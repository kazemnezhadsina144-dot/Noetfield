        <h1 class="hero-title">Building a governance layer for the AI economy.</h1>
        <p class="hero-subtitle">
          Noetfield exists for the people who must answer for AI decisions – boards, executives, and regulators – not
          for the teams building models. The focus is narrow on purpose: turning scattered technical artefacts into a
          small, disciplined record of how critical AI decisions are governed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section grid-2">

          <h2 class="section-title">What Noetfield is</h2>
          <p>
            Noetfield is a governance-first company working at the boundary between technical systems and fiduciary
            responsibilities. It is not a model vendor and not a fund. The work begins where AI and automation already
            move money, affect customers, and invite supervisory attention, and asks a simple question: how will this be
            explained and defended when it matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core artefacts are the <strong>Trust Brief</strong> – a 6-week engagement to map material AI use cases
            and draft the first entries – and the <strong>Trust Ledger</strong> – a plain-language record of critical AI
            decisions, safeguards, and accountability. Together, they form a thin governance layer that sits above
            model documentation, risk frameworks, and board processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noetfield is intentionally small and focused at this stage, working with a limited number of partners to
            refine the pattern before broader deployment.

          <div class="card-title">What Noetfield is and is not</div>
          <p>
            Noetfield works alongside existing vendors, advisors, and internal teams. It does not compete to build or
            sell models. It is focused on how decisions are recorded, surfaced, and owned.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not a model or infrastructure vendor.</li>
            <li>Not a fund or investment vehicle.</li>
            <li>Not a generic AI strategy or innovation shop.</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Thesis</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">A thin, durable record of critical AI decisions.</p>
          <p>
            In many organisations, AI is now woven into credit decisions, pricing, onboarding, triage, and trading.
            Logs, dashboards, and policies exist, but when something goes wrong – or when supervisors ask harder
            questions – the story has to be reconstructed from fragments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noetfield’s thesis is that a thin, durable record of a small number of critical AI decisions will matter
            more than ever: for boards discharging their duties, for regulators testing governance, and for executives
            making trade-offs. That record has to be plain-language, traceable, and linked back to the systems that
            engineers and risk teams already maintain.

          <div class="card-title">How Noetfield approaches governance</div>
          <p>
            The work is guided by a small set of principles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start from real-economy impact, not from abstract models.</li>
            <li>Work with existing frameworks; do not create parallel governance for AI.</li>
            <li>Keep artefacts sparse and readable – a few pages, not binders.</li>
            <li>Make ownership explicit for each decision and safeguard.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section grid-2">

          <h2 class="section-title">Who is behind Noetfield</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">A background at the intersection of law, governance, and systems.</p>
          <p>
            Noetfield is led by a founder with training in law and governance and hands-on experience in systems,
            digital platforms, and AI-adjacent work. The perspective is shaped by work across nonprofit, regulatory, and
            commercial contexts, with a consistent focus on who holds responsibility when systems scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company is based in British Columbia, Canada, and collaborates with partners and advisors across
            financial services, infrastructure, and policy domains. As the work expands, a small circle of independent
            experts and stewards will be invited into a more formal advisory structure.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-kicker">Orientation</div>
          <div class="card-title">Stewardship, not hype</div>
          <p>
            Noetfield is deliberately conservative in how it speaks about AI. The emphasis is on stewardship, duty, and
            clarity – not on acceleration for its own sake. The goal is to give boards and regulators enough visibility
            to say “yes” where appropriate, and “not yet” where the ground is not ready.
          </p>
          <div class="list-label">Initial focus</div>
          <p class="small">
            Early work is focused on a small number of institutions where the combination of regulatory pressure and
            internal motivation is strong. The Trust Brief and Trust Ledger are tuned in those environments before
            broader application.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">How to work with Noetfield</h2>
        <p>
          Most relationships begin with a Trust Brief – a 6-week engagement that maps where AI is material and produces
          the first page of the Trust Ledger. From there, organisations may continue to extend the Ledger internally or
          explore deeper collaboration, including early participation in Gate, Noetfield’s architecture and pilot
          programme.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are responsible for AI decisions at board, executive, or supervisory level and need a concrete way to
          make those decisions visible and defensible, Noetfield is designed for that responsibility.
