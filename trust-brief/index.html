      <h1>AI Trust Brief – 6-Week Pilot</h1>
      <p>
        The Noetfield AI Trust Brief is a focused, six-week pilot that maps where AI touches your work,
        highlights key risks and safeguards, and delivers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 6–10 page, board-ready AI Trust Brief in plain language.</li>
        <li>A 1–2 page Trust Ledger sample for one or two critical AI systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is time-boxed by design: narrow scope, concrete artefacts, no open-ended consultancy.
